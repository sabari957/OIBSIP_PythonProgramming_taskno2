## BMI Calculator

# Objective:
To create a simple Python program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a user based on their height and weight, and classifies the result into categories such as underweight, normal, overweight, and obese.

# Steps Performed:

1. Prompt the user to input height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms).


2. Calculate BMI using the formula:



bmi = weight / (height ** 2)

4. Display the BMI value and category to the user.


# Sample Output 

Enter your weight in kilograms: 70
Enter your height in meters: 1.75

Your BMI is: 22.86

BMI Category: Normal weight


# Tools Used:

Python 3.x (for program logic)

Basic input/output functions for user interaction


# Outcome:
A working console application that quickly calculates BMI and provides health category feedback.
